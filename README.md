# Penetration testing: a Beginner's Paradise

###### Notes from Andrew Scott's talk at Bsides Glasgow 2018

## How to get a job in pentesting?

1. Knowledge
2. Execution
3. Knowing where you fit in

#### What is penetration testing?

Essentially, pentesting is hacking with permission. The permission is the key factor, otherwise you're committing a crime! However, a key point worth knowing - especially when working at a consultancy - is that the test itself is not the main deliverable to the client, it's the report.

### 1. Knowing Stuff

#### Know how things work.

You'll need to know how different systems are put together, and why. This will be from the perspective of a sysadmin developer, software architect, etc. To achieve this, the following are some non-exhaustive options:

* Online Courses & Books
* Making a Personal Lab
* Reverse Engineering
* Academic Study
* Developing software and web applications with different languages and frameworks

#### Work out how to break stuff

Breaking stuff can be much more fun! Once you know how and why something works, breaking things becomes much less random and more focused and reasoned. Here's another non-exhaustive list of things that could be used as examples of 'breaking things':

* Capture the Flags
	* hackthebox.eu
	* Vendor challenges
	* hacking-lab.com
	* hack this site
	* etc. (there are loads!)
	* Vulnerable virtual machines (vulnhub)
* Exploit Development
	* CoreLan team have a good guide to binary exploit development
	* The OSCP has an exploit development section
* Breaking the things that you've already made; performing pentests on your own lab!
* Hacking some bug bounty programs to get a feel for it.
* Bug bounty hunting & CTF writeups
	* pentester.land is a good resource
	* Ippsec's YouTube videos are incredible 
* Reading up on research 
* Courses, training and online qualifications
* Conference talks (generally on YouTube)
	* DEFCON
	* BSides (BSides is pretty good for simpler stuff, DEFCON can be cool but very heavy!)
	* Blackhat
	* LevelUp
	* (the list is long!)

### 2. Execution

So you know how things work, and you can break it and do cool stuff... Now what? You need to show that you know stuff. With your CV. This could involve:

* Cool things you've done in your current job
* Open Source contributions
* Bounties, CVEs and responsible disclosure
* A blog, sharing information with the community
* Completed CTFs, possibly with writeups
* *Certifications*
	* CEH: Not worth it.
	* OSCP: Well-respected internationally. Very challenging exam! But all in all an awesome experience, the labs are great for learning infrastructure testing (and a bit of web application testing) and the exam is a great challenge. It also has a really good binary exploitation component, and a reporting component, making it very well-rounded.
	* CREST (CPSA / CRT): Well-respected mainly in the UK. Cheaper and arguably easier than the OSCP - but you don't get any of the course materials or lab that the OSCP offers. The CPSA is a multiple choice written exam and the CRT (which you can only take after passing the CPSA) is a practical exam.
	* Tiger Scheme: Similar to CREST, but less common. You might as well go for CREST certifications.
	* _from my experience, the main difference in challenges between CREST certs & OSCP is that CREST is more about time management whereas OSCP is about avoiding 'rabbit holes'. Both are useful skills._

### 3. Fitting in

Here's the most important thing of all: *Don't commit any computer-related crime*. You'll be tempted to, sure, but having any computer misuse act crimes on your record will prevent you from ever really getting into the industry. It's not worth it, and you don't know who is on the other end of your exploit. 

* Don't go to jail.
* Keep an objective eye on how good you are
* Figure out what is missing from your knowledge and break it down into categories
* Plan how to improve the areas you're lacking
* Work on your soft skills!
	* Reporting; general reading and writing of technical stuff to be understood by layfolk
	* Explaining complicated problems clearly, and understanding and catering to the technical abilities your audience

So you've got the skills, can display that knowledge and have stuff to back it up. What next? 


## Market yourself

Penetration testing is in pretty high demand, so there are some question you should ask yourself:

* Who do I want to work for? A big company? A boutique company? Remote?
* What is the salary range for entry level positions in my area?
* What type of testing do I prefer? (Web applications, infrasatructure, mobile, bit of everything, etc.)
* Should I apply directly or through recruiters? (Spoiler: Directly is almost always best!)
* How strong is my CV?
* What is the interview process? (Generally: Phone Screen > Technical Interview > Onsite Interview w/ technical components)

### Your CV

Here are some general tips for your CV

* Show what you can do as concisely as possible
* Aim for a *one page* CV
* Separate skills & achievements from responsibilities:	
	* Skills & achievements are thngs on top of what your normal day-to-day at work involves
	* Responsibilities should basically just be your job title.
* Include any relevant professional certifications or cool things you've done (like your rank on hackthebox, any CVEs you may have or CTFs you've won/completed)
* Unless relevant, drop a lot of university stuff. 
* Your cover letter should be short - about one paragraph. Include:
	* Why you want to work for them
	* 2 notable things that should be covered by the CV
	* Please find CV attached.
* Don't put your picture on the CV!
